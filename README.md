# 05-MESSENGER-MERCURY-SURFACE-CLASSIFICATION-UNSUPERVISED_DLR

## General description

Repository for the Science case from DLR with to understand the composition and evolution of planetary surfaces.

We aim to to extract the underlying information from this MESSENGER/MASCS infrared dataset using unsupervsed classification spectral data and combine/compare with chemical composition and surfaces ages inferred from crater counting.

## Analysis result

Expectations for the analysis result : 
  - Minimal : assessment if current remote sensing data from NASA/ MESSENGER could resolve different surface region of Mercury and ideas on the potential of upcoming ESA/BepiColombo mission for improvement.
  - Perfect : classifciation of Mercury surface region with uncertainties assessment, matching with laboratory measuremnts.
