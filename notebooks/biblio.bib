  abstract = {Volcanism onMercury has been indisputably identified at various locations on the surface, by means of both effusive and explosive volcanism. Its characterization is crucial to understand the evolution of the planet, in particular the thermal evolution of the mantle, and the volatile content of the planet. This analysis presents a detailed view of the pyroclastic deposits of the Caloris basin. Observations from theMercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS) are used to understand the spectral characteristics of the pyroclastic deposits, both in the visible and near-infrared. Additional calibration steps are proposed to reconcile the difference of absolute reflectance between the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) detectors. These calibration steps allow the use of the full spectral range of the MASCS instrument. Pyroclastic deposits exhibit a redder spectral slope in the VIS and NIR. This spectral slope diminishes toward the edge of the deposits to match that of Mercury's average surface. Spectral properties in the ultraviolet (UV) also change as a function of distance to the vent. Only the UV properties unambiguously separate the pyroclastic deposits fromMercury's average spectra. The spectral variations are consistent with a lower iron content of the pyroclastic deposits with respect to the average surface of Mercury, similar to what has been proposed for pyrolcastic deposits on the lunar surface. Nonetheless, given the limited illumination conditions diversity of theMASCS instrument, other causes such as grain size, space weathering, and bulk composition could also be accounted for the spectral variations. Variability of the pyroclastic deposits' properties within the entire basin are potentially identified between the three main clusters, and could be related to spaceweathering of deposits of different ages.},

Using the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) dataset we defined and mapped several units for each crater and for an external reference area far from any impact related deposits. For each of these units we extracted all spectra from the MESSENGER Atmosphere and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS) Visible-InfraRed Spectrograph (VIRS) applying a first order photometric correction. For all the mapped units, we analyzed the spectral slope in two wavelength ranges, 350-450 nm and 450-650 nm, and the absolute reflectance in the 700-750 nm range. Normalized spectra of Waters crater display a generally bluer spectral slope than the external reference area over both wavelength windows. Normalized spectra of Kuiper crater generally display a redder slope than the external reference area in the 350-450 nm window, while they display a bluer slope than the external reference area in the 450-650 nm wavelength range. The combined use of geological and spectral analyses enables reconstruction of the local scale stratigraphy beneath the two craters, providing insight into the properties of the shallower crust of Mercury. Kuiper crater, being \textasciitilde 4 times larger than Waters crater, exposes deeper layers with distinctive composition, while the result for Waters crater might indicate substantial compositional homogeneity with the surrounding intercrater plains, though we cannot exclude the occurrence of horizontal compositional heterogeneities in the shallow sub-surface.},

  abstract = {We describe a method for recovering the underlying parametrization of scattered data (mi) lying on a manifold M embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method, Hessian-based locally linear embedding, derives from a conceptual framework of local isometry in which the manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space {$\mathbb{R}$}n, is locally isometric to an open, connected subset {$\Theta$} of Euclidean space {$\mathbb{R}$}d. Because {$\Theta$} does not have to be convex, this framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations than the original ISOMAP algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves around a quadratic form {$\mathscr{H}$}(f) = {$\int$}M {$\parallel$}Hf(m){$\parallel<$}img class="highwire-embed tex" alt="Math" src="https://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/highwire/pnas/100/10/5591/embed/tex-math-1.gif"/{$>$}dm defined on functions f : M {$\mapsto$} {$\mathbb{R}$}. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and {$\mathscr{H}$}(f) averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M. The key observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an open, connected subset of {$\mathbb{R}$}d, then {$\mathscr{H}$}(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional null space consisting of the constant functions and a d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original isometric coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up to a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification of locally linear embedding and our theoretical framework as a modification of the Laplacian eigenmaps framework, where we substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian in place of one based on the Laplacian.},

In this work, the most recent results from MESSENGER's X-Ray Spectrometer, Gamma-Ray Spectrometer, and Neutron Spectrometer have been used to identify nine distinct geochemical regions on Mercury. Using a variation on the classical CIPW normative mineralogy calculation, elemental composition data is used to constrain the potential mineralogy of Mercury's surface; the calculated silicate mineralogy is dominated by plagioclase, pyroxene (both orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene), and olivine, with lesser amounts of quartz. The range in surface compositions indicate that the rocks on the surface of Mercury are diverse and vary from komatiitic to boninitic. The high abundance of alkalis on Mercury's surface results in several of the nine regions being classified as alkali-rich komatiites and/or boninites. In addition, Mercury's surface terranes span a wide range of SiO2 values that encompass crustal compositions that are more silica-rich than geochemical terranes on the Moon, Mars, and Vesta, but the range is similar to that of Earth. Although the composition of Mercury's surface appears to be chemically evolved, the high SiO2 content is a primitive feature and a direct result of the planet's low oxygen fugacity.},

  abstract = {The variety of evidence bearing on the nature of space weathering is reviewed. The effects of space weathering include spectral darkening, reddening and subdued absorption bands, and the distinctive magnetic electron spin resonance caused by single-domain metallic iron particles. Ever since the Apollo missions, two paradigms have dominated the thinking of the planetary science community concerning space weathering: (1) the optical effects are caused by impact-vitrified glass in agglutinates, and (2) the submicroscopic metallic iron results from the reduction of ferrous iron by the impact melting of minerals whose surfaces have been saturated with hydrogen from the solar wind. However, studies carried out since the Apollo program showed that both of these paradigms are invalid. A hypothesis first suggested by the author and his colleagues 26 years ago, but not generally accepted at that time, now appears to be essentially correct: Both the optical and magnetic effects are caused by metallic iron particles smaller than the wavelength in ubiquitous vapor-deposited coatings on soil particle surfaces and inside agglutinates. The vapor is generated by both solar wind sputtering and micrometeorite impact vaporization and injected preferentially downward into the porous regolith. The iron is reduced by a physical process, the selective loss of oxygen that occurs during deposition of the vapor, and does not require heating, melting, or a reducing environment. A mathematical theory that describes the optical effects of the submicroscopic iron quantitatively is derived and applied to the regoliths of the Moon, Mercury and an S asteroid.},

  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

All measurements were made at the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) at DLR. These experiments are motivated by the recent findings of the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission of hollows on Mercury and the notion that sulfides might be a candidate material for their formation. From these new measurements, we infer that all sulfides studied here display a diagnostic feature at or near 0.6. {$\mu$}m. The spectral contrast of this diagnostic feature can be strongly affected by heating of the samples to Mercury daytime temperatures of approximately 500. \textdegree C in a vacuum environment. Both the spectral slope and the color observed before and after thermal processing showed significant changes. The laboratory work also indicates that sulfides can be thermally decomposed at temperature below 500. \textdegree C, well below their melting point. Our results are consistent with models explaining hollows on Mercury's surface by the thermal decomposition of sulfides. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

  abstract = {Methods of dimensionality reduction provide a way to understand and visualize the structure of complex data sets. Traditional methods like principal component analysis and classical metric multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings. The book is primarily intended for statisticians, computer scientists and data analysts. It is also accessible to other practitioners having a basic background in statistics and/or computational learning, like psychologists (in psychometry) and economists. John A. Lee is a Postdoctoral Researcher of the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS). He is (co-)author of more than 30 publications in the field of machine learning and dimensionality reduction.

  abstract = {The elemental composition of Mercury's surface, which has been recently measured by the NASA MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft, suggests a mineralogy dominated by magnesium-rich orthopyroxene and feldspar. The most magnesium-rich and aluminium-poor regions of Mercury's surface (which are presumably orthopyroxene-rich) have compositions, and possibly mineralogies, analogous to terrestrial boninites and basaltic komatiites. Unfortunately, little is known about the spectral properties of komatiites, especially at the high surface temperatures of Mercury. We therefore have collected three terrestrial komatiites with different compositions plus a synthetic komatiitic sample, and measured their reflectances in the visible and thermal infrared spectral ranges. Samples divided into four grain size ranges (when enough material was available) were measured fresh and after thermal processing in vacuum (10 Pa) at 500\textdegree C, comparable to Mercury peak surface temperatures. Our measurements show that spectral changes between fresh and thermally processed samples occur in both spectral channels, but are stronger in the visible range, with reddening affecting all the samples, while darkening is more selective. It is important to note that darkening and reddening after thermally processing the samples are independent of the komatiites ferrous iron content. In fact the synthetic sample which is nearly iron-free is most strongly affected. From our study it turns out that thermally processing the samples in vacuum at Mercury surface temperature produces the removal of samples' colour centres. The results of our study show also that the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS) instrument on MESSENGER orbiting Mercury currently cannot distinguish between different compositions of komatiites, while the future MErcury Radiometer and Thermal infrared Imaging Spectrometer (MERTIS) on the upcoming ESA BepiColombo mission will resolve their differences in the 7 - 14 {$\mu$}m spectral range. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS) is one of seven science instruments onboard the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft en route to the planet Mercury. MASCS consists of a small Cassegrain telescope with 257-mm effective focal length and a 50-mm aperture that simultaneously feeds an UltraViolet and Visible Spectrometer (UVVS) and a Visible and InfraRed Spectrograph (VIRS). UVVS is a 125-mm focal length, scanning grating, Ebert-Fastie monochromator equipped with three photomultiplier tube detectors that cover far ultraviolet (115\textendash 180 nm), middle ultraviolet (160\textendash 320 nm), and visible (250\textendash 600 nm) wavelengths with an average 0.6-nm spectral resolution. It will measure altitude profiles of known species in order to determine the composition and structure of Mercury's exosphere and its variability and will search for previously undetected exospheric species. VIRS is a 210-mm focal length, fixed concave grating spectrograph equipped with a beam splitter that simultaneously disperses the spectrum onto a 512-element silicon visible photodiode array (300\textendash 1050 nm) and a 256-element indium-gallium-arsenide infrared photodiode array 850\textendash 1,450 nm. It will obtain maps of surface reflectance spectra with a 5-nm resolution in the 300\textendash 1,450 nm wavelength range that will be used to investigate mineralogical composition on spatial scales of 5 km. UVVS will also observe the surface in the far and middle ultraviolet at a 10-km or smaller spatial scale. This paper summarizes the science rationale and measurement objectives for MASCS, discusses its detailed design and its calibration requirements, and briefly outlines observation strategies for its use during MESSENGER orbital operations around Mercury.},

The mafic soil component is representative of widespread martian soils and is similar in composition to the martian dust. It possesses a ubiquitous hydrogen signature in ChemCam spectra, corresponding to the hydration of the amorphous phases found in the soil by the CheMin instrument. This hydration likely accounts for an important fraction of the global hydration of the surface seen by previous orbital measurements. ChemCam analyses did not reveal any significant exchange of water vapor between the regolith and the atmosphere. These observations provide constraints on the nature of the amorphous phases and their hydration.},

Near-infrared to ultraviolet spectra and images have provided evidence for the Fe2+-poor nature of silicate minerals, magnesium sulfide minerals in hollows and a darkening component attributed to graphite, but existing spectral data is insufficient to build a mineralogical map for the planet. Here we investigate the mineralogical variability of silicates in Mercury's crust using crystallization experiments on magmas with compositions and under reducing conditions expected for Mercury. We find a common crystallization sequence consisting of olivine, plagioclase, pyroxenes and tridymite for all magmas tested. Depending on the cooling rate, we suggest that lavas on Mercury are either fully crystallized or made of a glassy matrix with phenocrysts. Combining the experimental results with geochemical mapping, we can identify several mineralogical provinces: the Northern Volcanic Plains and Smooth Plains, dominated by plagioclase, the High-Mg province, strongly dominated by forsterite, and the Intermediate Plains, comprised of forsterite, plagioclase and enstatite. This implies a temporal evolution of the mineralogy from the oldest lavas, dominated by mafic minerals, to the youngest lavas, dominated by plagioclase, consistent with progressive shallowing and decreasing degree of mantle melting over time.},

We have compared optical and S-Band radar data for several large ({$>$} 20 km diameter), young craters on the Moon and Mercury and find evidence that secondary cratering plays a significant role in the formation of crater rays. Regions where rays appear bright to optical and radar sensors correspond to dense concentrations of secondary craters, and the observed radar enhancement appears to be a result of the deposition of blocky, immature ejecta from the secondary craters and/or the rocky, immature interior walls of the secondary craters. We define a new optical maturity index for Mercury and find that rays in radar and optical images correspond closely, indicating that the rays are rich in centimeter- to decimeter-sized clasts. Rays on the Moon are less prominent at radar wavelengths, suggesting that they are currently composed of smaller clasts, centimeter sized or less. This difference suggests that secondary craters are larger on Mercury and capable of excavating more decimeter-sized clasts. Furthermore, observations of rayed craters provide an opportunity to assign relative ages to the youngest craters on the Moon and Mercury. Although rayed craters on Mercury appear most similar to the youngest craters on the Moon, the apparent ages are more likely influenced by inherent differences in impact velocity, surface gravitational acceleration, and target properties that result in the formation of larger secondary craters on Mercury.},

We describe the procedures we used to select and filter data and to combine them to make the final maps, which are archived in NASA's Planetary Data System. Areal coverage is variable for the different element-ratio maps, with 100\% coverage for Mg/Si and Al/Si, but only 18\% coverage for Fe/Si north of 30\textdegree{} N, where the spatial resolution is highest. The spatial resolution is improved over previous maps by 10\textendash 15\% because of the inclusion of higher-resolution data from late in the mission when the spacecraft periapsis altitude was low. Unlike typical planetary data maps, however, the spatial resolution of the XRS maps can vary from pixel to pixel, and thus care must be taken in interpreting small-scale features. We provide several examples of how the XRS maps can be used to investigate elemental variations in the context of geological features on Mercury, which range in size from single \textasciitilde 100-km-diameter craters to large impact basins.

We can reproduce the volume and time of emplacement of the melt sheets in the interior of Caloris and Rembrandt if at about 3.7\textendash 3.8\,Ga convection in the mantle of Mercury was weak, an inference corroborated by the dating of the youngest large volcanic provinces.

The darkening agent, which has not been previously identified, is most concentrated within Mercury's lowest-reflectance spectral unit, the low-reflectance material. This low-reflectance material is generally found in large impact craters and their ejecta, which suggests a mid-to-lower crustal origin. Here we present neutron spectroscopy measurements of Mercury's surface from the MESSENGER spacecraft that reveal increases in thermal-neutron count rates that correlate spatially with deposits of low-reflectance material. The only element consistent with both the neutron measurements and visible to near-infrared spectra of low-reflectance material is carbon, at an abundance that is 1-3 wt\% greater than surrounding, higher-reflectance material. We infer that carbon is the primary darkening agent on Mercury and that the low-reflectance material samples carbon-bearing deposits within the planet's crust. Our findings are consistent with the formation of a graphite flotation crust from an early magma ocean, and we propose that the heavily disrupted remnants of this ancient layer persist beneath the present upper crust. Under this scenario, Mercury's globally low reflectance results from mixing of the ancient graphite-rich crust with overlying volcanic materials via impact processes or assimilation of carbon into rising magmas during secondary crustal formation.},

  abstract = {Data analysis plays an indispensable role for understanding various phenomena. Cluster analysis, primitive exploration with little or no prior knowledge, consists of research developed across a wide variety of communities. The diversity, on one hand, equips us with many tools. On the other hand, the profusion of options causes confusion. We survey clustering algorithms for data sets appearing in statistics, computer science, and machine learning, and illustrate their applications in some benchmark data sets, the traveling salesman problem, and bioinformatics, a new field attracting intensive efforts. Several tightly related topics, proximity measure, and cluster validation, are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs\textemdash 30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers\textemdash a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

  abstract = {American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Early during MErcury Surface Space ENvironment GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER)'s orbital mission, the Mercury Dual-Imaging System imaged the landform called hollows on the two craters Dominici and Hopper, using its Wide-Angle Camera with eight narrowband color filters ranging from 433 to 996 nm. An absorption feature centered in the MDIS 629 nm filter is evident in reflectance spectra for Dominici's south wall/rim hollows. A different absorption feature found in photometry of Dominici's center hollows extends through the MDIS 828 nm filter. Hollows in Hopper exhibit a weaker spectral absorption feature than that observed in Dominici's center. At Dominici, we postulate that fresher hollows-hosting material in the wall/rim was exposed to the space environment through a process of slumping of the overlying material. With time, local and global processes darken the hollows and change or mix the surface mineralogy, so that the spectral signature evolves. The hollows could contain low-density MgS and an opaque component, potentially derived from background material.},
